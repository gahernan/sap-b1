# Getting started with SAP Business One
{: #getting-started}

SAP Business One is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software especially designed for small-to-medium enterprises. It integrates business management - accounting and financials, purchasing and inventory, sales and customer relationships, and project management and operations - into one application. The single application eliminates the need for multiple installations and interfaces across separate modules. As your business grows, you can expand SAP Business One to fit your needs by adding from the over 500 add-on solutions sold exclusively through SAP partners.
