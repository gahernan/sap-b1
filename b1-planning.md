# Planning your SAP Business One implementation
{: #plan}

You're ready to begin planning your SAP Business One implementation. There are a couple of things to consider before you implement it - how are you going to use the application, and are you going to run it in the cloud or on-premises?

## How are you going to use SAP Business One?
{: #how_using}

You need to ask yourself how are you going to use SAP Business One _before_ you implement it. For example, do you just need the Financial Management and Sales and Customer Management modules to start? Maybe you need all three modules. For more information on the modules, see [Features ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.sap.com/products/business-one/features.html){: new_window}.

## How are you going to provision SAP Business One, in the cloud or on-premises?
{: #how_provision}

For help in making your decision, see [Provisioning SAP Business One](/docs/infrastructure/sap-b1/b1-provision.html#provision).
