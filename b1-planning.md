# Planning your SAP Business One implementation
{: #plan}

You're ready to begin planning your SAP Business One implementation. There are a couple of things to consider before you implement it - how are you going to use the application and are you going to run it in the cloud or on-premises?
{: shortdesc}

## How are you going to use SAP Business One?
{: #how_using}

You need to ask yourself how are you going to use SAP Business One _before_ you implement it. For example, how many concurrent users will be using the application at one time? Do you just need the Financial Management and Sales and Customer Management modules to start? Maybe you need all the modules (for more information on the modules, see [Features](https://www.sap.com/products/business-one/features.html){: external}).

## How are you going to provision SAP Business One, on SAP HANA or Microsoft SQL?
{: #how_provision}

For additional information, see [Provisioning SAP Business One](/docs/infrastructure/sap-b1?topic=sap-b1-provision).
