SAP Business One is provisioned either on-premises or on the cloud through an SAP partner. If you're planning on running on-premises, review the [SAP Business One Hardware Requirements Guide ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://sap.silvertouch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/b1-hardware-requirements-guide-new.pdf){: new_window} and [SAP Business One Platform Support Matrix ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/support-small-medium-enterprises/business-one.html){: new_window}. 

If you're planning on running on the cloud, select an SAP partner to host your SAP Business One modules.
